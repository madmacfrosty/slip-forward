# slip-forward

A gmail relay agent to automate forwarding my pay slips

# rationale

- Clojurescript over Javascript because I know Clojure
- Google functions because I think I'll spend more time on business logic once I've mastered them 

# tasks

1. Create hello world clojurescript from first principles
2. Deploy to google
3. Change function to count mails matching a filter
4. Write separate function to get attachments?
